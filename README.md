- End User Plugin (3ds max or else)
- HydraAPI (infrastructure)
- HydraCore (render engine, compute core)

This repo contain the second one.

# Usage

Windows:

1. Clone HydraAPI repo
2. Copy 'bin2' folder content to 'C:/[Hydra]/bin2' under windows;
3. Open 'hydra_api/HydraNewAPI1.sln' under windows with visual studio 2015 or later; If use 2015 you will need to downgrade platform toolset to v140 (2015).
4. **Select x64 configuration**
5. Set 'main' as startup project.
6. Now you can run some demo and tests

Linux:
1. Clone HydraAPI repo
2. sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev
3. sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev libglfw3
4. sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev; [look this guide if have problems with OpenCL](doc/opencl_setup_linux.md)
5. use Cmake;
6. build and install HydraCore using Cmake and approptiate instruction

Optionally, to build and use python bindings library (tested only under Linux):
1. Get pybind11 as submodule (HydraAPI root dir): 
- git submodule init
- git submodule update
2. sudo apt-get install python3-dev (install Python headers)
3. Build hydra bindings with Cmake (hydra_api/hydra_api_py)
 
 * mkdir build (to create "hydra_api/hydra_api_py/build")
 * cd build
 * select specific python version specify CMake variable: **cmake .. -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/your/python3**
 
4. Import resulting library in your python project

Some examples can be found in hydra_api/hydra_api_py/hydraPyTests.py
